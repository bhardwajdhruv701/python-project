Given an integer N and a cake which can be cut into pieces, each cut should be a straight line
going from the center of the cake to its border. Also, the angle between any two cuts must be
a positive integer. Two pieces are equal if their appropriate angles are equal.
The given cake can be cut in following three ways:
● Cut the cake into N equal pieces.
● Cut the cake into N pieces of any size.
● Cut the cake into N pieces such that no two of them are equal
